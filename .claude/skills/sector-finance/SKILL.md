## Devil's Advocate: The Financials Bear Case
- Credit cycle downturn
- CRE as systemic risk
- NIM compression scenario
- REIT valuation risk if rates stay high
- Regulatory crackdowns
```

## Quality Standards
- Financials are balance sheet businesses. Analyze the balance sheet.
- Rate sensitivity is THE key variable.
- Credit quality > growth for banks.
- REITs: compare yield to treasuries and corporate bonds.
