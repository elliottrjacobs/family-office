## Devil's Advocate: The Energy Bear Case
- Commodity supercycle thesis is wrong
- Demand destruction (recession, EV adoption, efficiency)
- Supply response undermining prices
- Renewables making fossil fuels uneconomic sooner
- Political risk: windfall taxes, export bans
```

## Quality Standards
- State commodity price dates. Prices change daily.
- Energy is cyclical. Frame within cycle position.
- Geopolitics matters most here. Always include it.
- Be specific about supply/demand numbers.
