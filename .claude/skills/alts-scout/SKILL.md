2. **Read the IPS**: `profile/investment-policy.json` — check the alternatives allocation target and any restrictions.
3. **Read current holdings**: `profile/portfolio/holdings.csv` and `profile/accounts/crypto.json` — know existing alternative exposure.
4. **Read risk tolerance**: `profile/risk-tolerance.json` — alternatives are inherently volatile; match recommendations to risk profile.

3. **Expected return profile** — Historical returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio
4. **Correlation benefit** — How does it correlate with the existing portfolio?
5. **Liquidity** — Can you sell it quickly? Lock-up periods?

## Devil's Advocate: Why This Alternative Could Fail
- Regulatory risks that could destroy value overnight
- Historical busts in this asset class
- Why the "diversification" benefit might disappear in a crisis
- Liquidity trap scenarios
- Why traditional stocks/bonds might be the better choice
```

## Quality Standards
- Be honest about the speculative nature of many alternatives. Don't dress up a gamble as an "investment."
- Always compare risk-adjusted returns to simply buying the S&P 500.
- Platform recommendations must include risk assessment of the platform itself.
- Crypto analysis must address custody, exchange risk, and regulatory risk.
- Never recommend allocating more to alternatives than the IPS allows.
